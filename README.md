# Mandrake Shooter
This is a game about launching Mandrakes at toxic barrels to knock them down. Right now I would say that this project is in its minimum viable product stage.
# Controls
The way you control the character is that you use WASD to move the catapult. To launch the mandrake, you have to pull back on your mouse and release, similar to Angry Birds. The lives are the pictures in the top left. These represent how many times you can shoot the mandrake again.
